# Fog Detection

All codes are in the file of `fog_detect_using_tensorflow.ipynb`. As the name suggests, I used Tensorflow for model training. I first compress/resize the images and then do the training. Model is a simple Convolutional neural network. 

If you are going to use these codes for fog detection, you'll need a tensorflow model that I obtained but I haven't exported the model yet. I'll do that tonight or tomorrow. Until then, you may get yourself familiar with my codes if you wish. Let me know there is anything you do not understand. 

One thing to notice is that the current model is only for images. 

You can veiw and download the data for model training [here](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/i0bkhwtrxaco7ka7lil3ed5btyu00num).
